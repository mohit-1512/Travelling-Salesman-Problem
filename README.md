Problem Statement
-----------------

Designed two search strategies that solve N-city Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) with cities being numbered 0,…,N-1; one of these search strategies (SIM) can be quite simple; however, the second strategy (SOPH) should be more sophisticated. Design a software system that implements SIM and SOPH and provides the capability to run the SIM and SOPH for 3 given cost functions.

•	Implemented Heuristic search strategy (A-Star) as a simple approach and Simulated Annealing algorithm as sophisticated approach as to fix the exponential time problem caused by A Star.
•	Compared the results of both search strategies to determine which search technique worked better in which scenarios.

For more details regarding the problem statement and the approached used please refer 'Problem Statement.docx' and Report.pdf respectively.
